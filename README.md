# RelayshieldMqttController

An [Arduino](http://arduino.cc) project to control a [Seeedstudio Relay shield V1.0](https://www.seeedstudio.com/Relay-shield-p-693.html) via [MQTT](http://mqtt.org).

## Requirements

An Arduino UNO compatible board with ethernet, for example [Freetronics EtherTen](http://www.freetronics.com.au/products/etherten) or a board along with an ethernet shield is required to host the code.

In addition, an MQTT broker is required to running and accessible from the Arduino. Example code is provided for [openHAB](http://openhab.org) and Python, to support the control of the relays.

## Configuration

The code makes use of the [NetEEPROM library](https://github.com/gregington/NetEEPROM) to configure the MAC address of the Ethernet hardware. See the examples for how to set a MAC address. Utilising the library means the MAC address does not need to be defined in the code, allowing an IP address to be assigned automatically without code changes to multiple boards (assuming a DHCP server is available on network).

The MQTT broker address is required to be defined within the source code. Set the address on line 10 of file [mqttConfig.h](../RelayshieldMqttController/mqttConfig.h).

## Compiling code

The project is structured for use with [PlatformIO](http://platformio.org). If using PlatformIO, the external libraries used in the project will be automatically added, apart from [MemoryFree](https://github.com/sudar/MemoryFree), which needs to be added to the project lib directory, using

```
cd lib
rm -rf MemoryFree/
git clone https://github.com/sudar/MemoryFree.git
```

To compile the code using the Arduino IDE the following additional libraries are required
- [NetEEPROM](https://github.com/gregington/NetEEPROM)
- [PubSubClient](https://github.com/knolleary/pubsubclient)

# Using program

In order to make use of the program MQTT structured messages must be generated.

To control each relay is required with the topic

```
relayshield/control/relay
```

and payload `x,y`

where
- `x` is the relay number (1 to 4)
- `y` is either `0` or `1` to switch the relay off or on, respectively

For example to swich relay 2 on, a message in the following form is used

```
relayshield/control/relay 2,1
```

On the change of state of a relay, a status message is generated by the Arduino, with the topic

```
relayshield/status/relay
```

and payload in the format `x,y`, where

where
- `x` is the relay number (1 to 4)
- `y` is either `0` or `1` to signifity whether the relay is off or on, respectively

Other status messages are generated for reliability. See the file [mqttConfig.h](../RelayshieldMqttController/mqttConfig.h) for details.
